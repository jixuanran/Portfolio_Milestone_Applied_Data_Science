It takes respectable pictures (1600 x 1200), which send easily to your email. Texting (when I NEED to) is very easy. I like the fact that it fists easily into my pocket.CONS:(1) The old-style, larger connector (not the mini USB, like everyone else)(2) No voice commands, as are featured with the Pantech flip phones (making hands-free a little less hands-free). While driving, I can't just tell the phone to dial a number, like I can with other Pantech phones.\n",

This product should be exlusively for the Asian market while Lenovo does not provide technical service worldwide for its smartphones, its interface for PC is in Chinese Language. Recomended for Consumers who have advanced knowledge of programming or Chinese (of course) P.D: The item has technical issues with the charger slot, but knowing how they deal with the customers i've actually prefer not even write them. Never again.\n",

      "After reading many of the reviews, I was under the impression that the well documented problem with the screen protector had been resolved, so I decided to go ahead and order one. Mine arrived yesterday, and unfortunately the problem has NOT been resolved at all. I can see from the reviews that customers have been complaining about this issue since last fall, and given Otterbox's responses there is no question they have been well aware of the problem. I find it amazing that Otterbox has not pulled this defectively designed product off the market. I realize their products have a great reputation, but talk about a way to quickly ruin it...wow.\n",
      "Not good\n",
      "I ordered this phone expecting a 5s. Imagine my shock when I opened the box to find a 5 in there. The phone is in good condition, but WAS NOT AS LISTED!\n",

At first I wasn't looking for a flagship phone or something super high tech I just needed something that worked. When I purchased the phone I knew what I was getting I checked out the specs and everything. When it arrived I was excited to get it set up and ready for use. After Updating the phone I realized that I only had 5 gigabytes left of internal phone storage which I thought was ridiculous. So there was over 10 GIGS OF UPDATES!!!! Absolutely Ridiculous. I really liked the size of the phone but that was really the only thing that stood out as far as appearance goes but lacked a finger print scanner and other features that most phones have now a days especially for this price. I really recommend looking elsewhere for a phone with better features and that is more up to date than the XA Ultra. Overall its just a really mediocre phone.\n",

I'm sure I speak for hundreds of thousands when I say that Jitterbug's original premise was terrific: a small, big numbers cell phone that was only a telephone. Jitterbug now services the earlier generations of their phones, but no longer sells them. In my view the company is ignoring a large market by not offering a high quality version of the original; I'd be happy to buy two.The Jitterbug Plus is a) too large and heavy for my taste, b) has features I neither want nor need, and c) it's unnecessary; many other phones offer as much and more for less money and cheaper plans. I just want a new and improved original Jitterbug (better quality, range, etc.).\n",

      "The Galaxy itself is an awesome looking phone with possibly the best display out currently. The colors are vibrant and the camera is excellent. The platinum gold is very unique and it seems to change colors depending on lighting - silver or gold. It's very slippery, but the dual glasses makes it feel premium. The performance is smooth as well. The phone itself is 5 stars. The one I received however is a 1 star due to the front glass panel being tilted. And yes, please read the critical reviews about the factory seals being broken or nonexistent. Mine came with no factory seal, just a one sided sticker that contained a barcode and place of origin. And please read their policies, because some of them are ridiculous. If you get this phone from the wrong seller, you will be screwed. I have a suspicion some sellers are actually selling refurbished (or phones that has been fixed) phones as brand new. All I can say from my experience, beware of WWD. Other than that, the phone is awesome, just be cautious.\n",

The Otterbox Defender that I bought for my 6+ fits flush with the iPhone screen and works perfect. My wife got an iPhone 6+ as well and wanted a colored case. Mine fit perfect (black), so why should't hers. But hers (jade/teal) does not fit at all. You can barely get the case closed over the phone. You feel like you are going to break something forcing the case closed. And then when you get it, the Otterbox screen protector bows up so that it is not in contact with the iPhone screen. The reason we purchased the iPhone 6+ is the bigger screen and keyboard to make texting and emailing easier. The Otterbox makes the iPhone worthless for either.\n",

The reality is so far from the theory. Poor camera and when i say poor i mean it. A Samsung galaxy prime, chip phone from cricket performance 10 times better for a fraction of the cost. The \"incredible sound\" is a joke. My previous phone the moto pure edition, that's a great sound stuff! This kind of phone can compete with any med level phone like Huawei p8 lite, the only difference is the 150 dlls between both. As soon as i installed the chip i knew was a big mistake got it. Tried to return it but Amazon make me wait like a month to start the refund procedure. My advice don't even read the specs, get a 200 dlls cellphone for the same performance or get a flag ship (a real one) if u can afford it.\n",

Is there a way that I can check to insure the phone is truly unlocked? Overall everything works great on Wi-Fi and I would love to get my device working....\n",

      "Looks cool, works great when new. It's just over a year old. In recent months, I have gone through 2 SD cards. Even without any SD card, it shuts off a few times day. It cost me exactly the same amount of money as Moto G2 which I bought for my wife a month earlier. Her phone still works great, mine will be heading towards the trash can soon. You are better off buying a reputable brand than a Chinese junk with attractive specs. I learned the hard way.\n",

      "In theory the specs are great, with some trusted brands involved like bmw studio designs, Dolby, jbl... Etc. The sony lens and the snapdragon chips make you think the phone is a bargain. The reality is so far from the theory. Poor camera and when i say poor i mean it. A Samsung galaxy prime, chip phone from cricket performance 10 times better for a fraction of the cost. The \"incredible sound\" is a joke. My previous phone the moto pure edition, that's a great sound stuff! This kind of phone can compete with any med level phone like Huawei p8 lite, the only difference is the 150 dlls between both. As soon as i installed the chip i knew was a big mistake got it. Tried to return it but Amazon make me wait like a month to start the refund procedure. My advice don't even read the specs, get a 200 dlls cellphone for the same performance or get a flag ship (a real one) if u can afford it.\n",

Decent enough hardware, the real kicker is that BLU has ended all support for all of their Life phones (Life Play, Life View, Life One, Life Pure, etc). So, while the phone does work today, there will be no software updates. As Android moves forward, Blu Life phones will forever be stuck (on 4.2.1 for the Life Pure Mini).I've already run into a few instances where I can't install apps due to Android 4.3+ requirements.

The \"incredible sound\" is a joke. My previous phone the moto pure edition, that's a great sound stuff! This kind of phone can compete with any med level phone like Huawei p8 lite, the only difference is the 150 dlls between both. As soon as i installed the chip i knew was a big mistake got it. Tried to return it but Amazon make me wait like a month to start the refund procedure.

      "I needed a new phone so I was shopping around for one and came across the \"Sony Xperia XA Ultra\" don't be fooled by the fancy name it's not as great as it sounds. At first I wasn't looking for a flagship phone or something super high tech I just needed something that worked. When I purchased the phone I knew what I was getting I checked out the specs and everything. When it arrived I was excited to get it set up and ready for use. After Updating the phone I realized that I only had 5 gigabytes left of internal phone storage which I thought was ridiculous. So there was over 10 GIGS OF UPDATES!!!! Absolutely Ridiculous. I really liked the size of the phone but that was really the only thing that stood out as far as appearance goes but lacked a finger print scanner and other features that most phones have now a days especially for this price. I really recommend looking elsewhere for a phone with better features and that is more up to date than the XA Ultra. Overall its just a really mediocre phone.\n",

      "Bought the Honor 5X thinking it may be awesome for $199. While it was decent, the UI was just too slow to handle. The EMUI was neat in many ways but the lags and stutters after a few days became really annoying. Returned it and bought the Nexus 5X since it was on sale for $349. Wow!Have not owned a Nexus since the Nexus 5. My how I missed it. Loaded all my apps and got everything arranged that I wanted. No lag anywhere, fast as pie and things just friggin' work. Android 6.0.1 works wonderfully and T-Mobile WiFi Calling and VoLTE worked straight out of the box. Wonderful.Owned the Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4 (loved that phone) and the Nexus 5 - glad to be back. This is a great handset and it's so nice to be away from phablets for a while (iPhone 6s Plus as nice, but ohh so big). Considered the Nexus 6P too - but the added cost and the size made me sway towards the 5X. No complaints! Love this thing.UPDATE 2-27-16: Wow. What a few weeks difference makes. This phone has slowed down, it constantly lags, battery life has gotten worse (even after deleting the notorious Facebook battery-hogging app). I have researched quite a bit and even after deleting the cache partition in recovery mode, deleting the disk cache every day, doing a restore without a previous backup - this thing will just crawl doing several things like listening to Pandora, trying to take a picture (OMG it lags here) and in other areas). Never seen a phone lag and stutter and crash this bad, and this is a phone with a SnapDragon 808 and vanilla Android! I am perplexed and after reading quit a few forum posts at Android Central, this seems very common. Unreal. Well, sent an exchange at Amazon for the Nexus 6P yesterday and going to try that unit, even though the size concerns me a bit. We'll see. I've had several Nexus phones (Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4 and Nexus 5) and have never seen performance be a problem like this. Sigh - Google must have really blown in on the Nexus 5X.\n",

In my view the company is ignoring a large market by not offering a high quality version of the original; I'd be happy to buy two.The Jitterbug Plus is a) too large and heavy for my taste, b) has features I neither want nor need, and c) it's unnecessary; many other phones offer as much and more for less money and cheaper plans.

      "DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT from Number 1 Distributors. LG G3 D850 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-HD Smartphone - Metallic Black . I just received this yesterday, brand new. It came with Kitkat on it, today I tried to update to Android v6 Marshmallow and it only updated to Lollipop 5.0.1. I keep trying to update but it keeps saying my phone is already Up To Date. I contacted LG and they said that the phone, LG G3 D850 is available for the Marshmallow update. I then drove 70 miles away to a Corporate AT&T store, waited for over an hour, just for them to tell me that AT&T did do a rollout ( OTA ) of Android v6 Marshmallow for this device but they said there is nothing they can do to help me or to even get v6 on it. That only took about 3 minutes of my time for nothing. I currently use Straight Talk and inserted my SIM in and it worked for making calls. I didn't change the APN settings as I left it to its default of ATT Nextgenphone and was connected to my home WiFi when I did update to only Android 5.0.1. Upon me purchasing this product, I chose to \"Ask\" the Seller a question and utilizing the drop down menu to had select \"Customization\". Well, THEY or AMAZON replied back to me via email but they never answered my direct question. I had told the seller that if this phone didnt come with Marshmallow or there was a problem getting it that I will indeed return it. All they said was something in the lines that I'll be pleased with this product. Another thing....the BRIGHTNESS on this phone is still dim no matter how high you turn it up as if it had like a tint look to it. This is not tolerable. Prior to buying this product, I had purchased the BLUE version of this from Edge Cellular which came as used but I knew it before hand but it was more than used then anything when I received it. Had hairline cracks on all outer edges as well a Red Dot on the screen which I had taken that to a ATT store and they said that was indication that the screen is about to go at some given point. The Blue version of this from Edge Cellular came with Android v6 Marshmellow, I am not sure how they even managed that when this Metallic Black one that is New isn't getting updated to Marshmallow. So in reality of it all, the Description of this Model number has to be wrong when it says its upgradeable to v6. Did a google search and seems it can be done \"IF\" you get the phone ROOTED with CyanogenMod 13. So overall, I do not suggest for Anyone to buy this particular Model from any seller and/or Amazon. Again, seems that sellers seem to neglect customers questions to them and if they do reply, don't expect them to reply to your exact question. I will be returning this product and most likely will never trust anything on Amazon again as this is 2 back to back orders in a week or so apart that I've had issues with\n",

Rhe graphics are crisp and sharp, the speed is faster than my Samsung galaxy 5 and my moms iphone5.... The speakers are the loudest I've ever heard on a phone before and to top it off my 10 year old played games on it all day christmas and it didn't even come close to dying... all day!

The comments section is littered with the same exact problems I'm having. But they're 'limited in scope'That's a totally absurd excuse. Totally absurd. I could give an analogy, but they'd just get it deleted.Think about it -- \"Limited in scope\"Seriously?This should have been fixed YEARS ago.

      "Third time is a charm! FINALLY I got what I paid for, after returning two suspicious devices!DEVICE No. 1:So... I ordered this Galaxy S6 Edge for my girlfriend as her birthday gift. I did not want to purchase it through a carrier, so I got the G925F model, knowing it won't be covered by Samsung's warranty because it's a global version. However, when I received the phone, I couldn't help but think it has been opened. As you can see in my picture, the original Samsung seal has been cut open (clean cut) and then a new sticker was on top of that to cover that up. I thought I saw two stickers, but when my girlfriend lifted the first one, the second one at the bottom was revealed and we could immediately see that the case has been opened. Even thought this was sold at a \"NEW\" device, my girlfriend felt like it has been opened previously and she did not want to keep anything that was suspicious. I purchased the first one from WIRELESS PLACE. I contacted the seller, asking for explanation and the seller just said I was accusing him/her and basically provided no explanation. I left a seller feedback, and Amazon immediately deleted it saying they fulfilled the order and it wasn't the seller's fault. However, how is Amazon responsible for an item when it was supplied like that by the seller? I don't get it. Anyhow - I was able to return the first device. I do not recommend Wireless Place at all.DEVICE No. 2:Because we returned the first one, now my girlfriend was sad because she didn't have the gift on her birthday. I immediately ordered a second one, this time from SHOPEBEST. This time, before I placed the order I reached out to the seller and asked specifically, \"I have purchased it from another seller and the seal was tampered with- is your device 100% brand-new, never been opened?\" and the seller confirmed the device was a brand-new device and it's never been opened. So I was confidant in my purchase and ordered it from this seller and I thought everything was good to go....Well, we received the device from Shopebest, and there were a few things that were wrong with this order. First, the seller said it was G925I model (very confidant seller, guaranteed it was the i model) but the one we received was G925F model. We did not complain at all about this - just thought the seller did not keep good track of what they were selling. Because the F model has more LTE bands, it was a plus.However, the case had a problem..... it did not have the Samsung seal on the short side of the box, it was just put on the box, rather randomly, on the long side of the box and it wasn't even straight. Also, my girlfriend opened it up and checked the phone, and guess what? The OS was already upgraded to 5.1.1!!!!!!!!!! That means someone has opened it, used it, and upgraded the phone to the latest OS. And even if you reset the phone to factory setting, you can't uninstall the OS (without rooting the phone). So we had our suspicion, but wanted to make sure and check with Samsung before we make false accusations. So we e-mailed Samsung UAE (the phone said it was from UAE) and received the following answers.An excerpt from the email we received from the Samsung UAE agent (what is in the parenthesis is my question):(1. Where on your S6 Edge box do you place the Samsung warning seal that says _quotdo not accept if this seal has been broken_quot? Is it the top or bottom, or the sides where it''''s longer in length?)\"For your inquiry, Samsung Gulf Electronics supply all Mobile phones to two Authorized distributors in UAE (Eros & Axiom) and you can find two Samsung seal placed on the device box at the narrow sides then the distributor seal placed on four or two sides of the device box after packing using transparent plastic.\"(2. What Android OS did this come out of the factory? If a phone is straight from the factory, should it have OS 5.0.1 or 5.1.1?)\"Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge (Gulf model) come with Android Lollipop 5.0.1\"(3. Based on my IMEI number, do I have the 925F model or is this a 925I model?)\"We have verified the IMEI number and found that the device having the market code of UAE the model number is SM-G925F.\"So there you go, we now know for sure that it wasn't exported by an authorized dealer and also the seal was not put on the longer side of the case by Samsung - they always put it on the short side. I knew about this because I have purchased Galaxy phones before from Korea, from Samsung store and they all had the \"DO NOT ACCEPT\" seal on the short sides. So we got confirmation that this device has been upgraded by someone else who has opened the box and used the phone. Of course, returned it. At this point, the only reason we were able to remain calm was the Amazon's policy and its customer service reps. It was ridiculous.DEVICE No. 3:FINALLY! I purchased the last one - was going to just go to AT&T and purchase it outright if this one had problems too - from the seller OPEN GROUP WIRELESS. As soon as we opened the package, we knew we got the real deal this time. Please refer to my images that I attached below. They have all the seals where they are supposed to be, no double seal, no misplaced / randomly placed seal, etc. This one had the Samsung seal on the short side and the dealer sticker also. We carefully examined the package and opened the box. The GF checked the phone, OS, and everything and everything was good! She is now super happy that she got the good product. We called the seller before placing this order as well, and the person who answered the phone at Open Group Wireless could not be any more rude. She was extremely rude, but we don't even care because we finally got what we paid for. The reason why we purchased from this seller is because when we asked what side the seal was, the woman said it was on the short side.Now, we are getting more information about the device through Samsung Korea customer service center (located in Suwon) to see if this was exported by authorized dealer and to trace it back to the country of origin because now the device does not say where it's from. Based on their answer, if we find anything contrary to our belief that it is a good, genuine, unused product, then I'll update the review then.I am posting this review on all three product pages.\n",

In addition the customer service makes many mistakes from setting up the phone to billing. Lastly, it is not cost effective. The minutes go by quick and is very costly. I just purchased a Samsung Galaxy Prime Core for $39.00 without a plan from T-Mobile. I pay by the month for $40.00 and get unlimited talk, text and 3GB of data. In addition, if there are any issues with the phone or plan T-Mobile will take care of it on the spot. My recommendation is to stay away from plans that have no stores, they usually outsource their customer service in order to cut costs and you will compromise your private information.\n",

I stopped by all 3 service providers in Korea and they said that they have met so many ppl like me (buying from USA to use it in Korea cuz its cheaper) and approximately only 20~30% have found it useful in Korea. Therefore, it is 70% likely that u will be in trouble using this phone in Korea lol Anyway, thx Amazon for accepting my refund request.\n",

Reached out to the seller. No response. Too bad cause it was fantastic to start withOriginal, 1 month ownership review;Phone was just as described, very fast shipping. I have had a couple of little glitches with this phone, probably because it was 2 years old and some of the updates don't seem to be working out for the current running system.

When you get the phone you have to spend a least 30 min to an hour setting up for your carrier (a bit scary if you doesn't know what you're doing). Over all if you only need to make a call this for you, otherwise don't expect the phone features to work. If you only need to make call I recommend a free government phone.\n",

      "So far, I pretty much dislike this phone (\"hate\" is too strong a word).All-in-all, I'm fairly unimpressed, and I don't understand the \"hype\" about this phone; last month when it was introduced, I even saw it featured on a local TV News segment. I suppose it's major draw is it's relative affordability compared to the Big Brand Name smartphones?CONS:I've been looking for WEEKS to find a complete User Manual because the manufacturer DOESN'T HAVE ONE. It seems that there are a lot of things/features/functions not covered in the Quick Start Guide.The battery life is unimpressive; my 3-and-a-half year old Samsung Note (the original, first generation Note) has the same battery life as this.Why the heck is the Ringtone/notification so FREAKING LOUD even at the lowest setting?!Why can you NEVER turn-off the vibrate/buzz regardless of turning it off in all the settings that give you the option of turning it off? You can either have the lowest (but pretty darn loud) volume set for ringing and notifications, or vibrate/buzz. There is no \"silent\". Silent = buzz.Even with the option of the LED Notification light, which is meant to preclude the use of buzz.PROS:Yes, the display/screen quality and resolution are very nice.The overall quality of the manufacturing is excellent and exactly like any of the Big Name Brand expensive phones (you cannot tell that it is a \"low-priced\" phone at all, it looks and feels great).I prefer big phones/phablets and find this phone is a nice size.I cannot comment on the JBL/Harmon sound; I have heard only ringtones and notification tones and buzzing, which seem the same quality as any modern, good-to-best-quality name brand smartphone.In fairness, some of the things I don't like I suspect are just my own fault for not learning Android 5/Lollipop completely yet - and maybe a lot of stuff I just really hate about Lollipop...But I'm comparing this to another family member's new phone that runs Lollipop and this Alcatel phone has some very weird and undesirable features/functions, and is missing some of the more desirable ones (for my uses).It could also very well be that this is simply not the right kind of Smartphone for me.I use my phones for Internet if needed when I'm not near a PC, messaging, the occasional actual phone call, and photos;never as a music player or for watching TV/movies/videos or as an eReader (that's what my massive LED HD TVs and tablets are for).\n",
      "I bought this direct from Amazon, and their \"unlocked\" phone is technically unlocked, but it has Cingular-branded firmware.For anyone not familiar with that, \"branded\" is a euphemism for \"hacked up by the carrier to remove features and replace useful menu options with links to buy stuff.\" I guess \"branded\" is shorter than saying all that.This is not a \"clean\" L7. You may as well buy an unlocked Cingular phone from ebay.I have not yet checked all features to see what has been removed from this phone, although I immediately notice that even signed Java applications require constant \"permission\", while an unbranded phone would accept the Verisign certificate.\n",

      "(See updates below)First off, I'm not into cell phones and gadgets. My previous phone was a Google Nexus S, which lasted me 4 years. If you're looking for a review of the phone compared to other recent models, you might skip this.I picked this phone because of the size, battery life and apparently the top of the line specs it provides. While I do not care much about features and specs I do plan to keep the phone for a while and having top notch specs today ensures that it won't be completely outdated in a few years.*Form Factor and Build*The size of this phone is very nice compared to the giant slabs you get nowadays. It is slightly bigger than my old Nexus and any bigger would probably become annoying to hold. The build seems pretty solid. Sony claims the phone is waterproof. This results in the charge port and other ports being covered by a rubber plug. I can't help but think that constantly taking the plug on and off to charge is going to wear it pretty quickly.The phone is extremely slippery. This is one of the truly pointless things I see manufacturers do nowadays. There is really no point in making a device that can slide down a book placed on a table, just to keep up with the equally stupid competition and to make stupid consumers feel good about a smooth glassy phone. Bottom line: get a cover.* Battery Life*This is truly impressive. I've only had the phone for a week, so I do not know how long it will hold up, but I've run the phone on one charge for 4 days of moderate use (several phone calls, moderate texting, reading news over lunch, music in the gym). LTE and Wifi enabled. At the end of those 4 days I still had like 25% battery left.*Screen, Camera, Features *I'm not going to say much here because I really don't have a good baseline. The screen looks really crisp and nice. The whole thing is pretty fast. The camera looks good too, although 20 megapixel is of course yet another pile of horse crap Sony sells to dumb consumers. The gestures feature is pretty nice. I can pick up the phone by just putting it to my ear (no need to touch the screen). Really nice when driving, so that I don't have to take my driving gloves off.* Software *I bought the international version of this phone. I was hoping for something that comes with minimum bloatware, certainly without any telecom provider bloatware. Unfortunately the phone I got was apparently packaged for the German T-Mobile and there was all kinds of software from them. Additionally there is Amazon software (never asked for that either) and bloatware from Sony itself. I've found out that the Sony stuff will try to show you ads for their movies and whatnot. For example the Gallery app (which is called Album and tries to sell you Sony's cloud photo album solution) will have an ad at the end of the pictures.I was able to get rid of most of this crap, however all of this is extremely annoying. If I'm paying full, unsubsidized price for a phone I at least can expect the manufacturer to refrain from shoving its crappy ads in my face.All in all though, this is a pretty good offering and the size and battery life really make it worth for me.**** Update: ****So after using the phone for a while I noticed some things I definitely don't like. The call quality is actually mediocre at best. The swype style keyboard that comes with the phone appears to be different from the standard one in the Android stack and is far inferior to the latter.There is a far bigger issue however. Yesterday I dropped the phone from what was probably 2 feet. The screen cracked in the corner, which itself wasn't the big issue, however the touchscreen now only works on something like 30% of the screen. The top half of the screen won't work and the bottom half is mostly misaligned. The phone as such is hardly usable. Obviously Sony refused to replace it under warranty.Now I understand that when things fall they might break, however this was by far not a harsh fall. All of my previous smartphones have taken *a lot* of beating. My Nexus S got kicked down a stairwell, fell from an industrial vehicle and nothing. This is an utter joke of build quality from Sony and needless to say I will be looking at something else.\n",
      "Some of these sold on Amazon do not have LTE 4G. Read the fine print.Even though all the grand primes sold in US have LTE the ones sold on Amazon by third parties don't have it.\n",
      "I'm not really like\n",
      "I'm am not pleased to have to be editing my initial review, but after having owned this phone for just about 3 months it now will not hold a charge and will only turn on when the charger is plugged into it. Of course it turns itself off again and repeats this process continuously until I disconnect it again. I loved this phone, but I never would have spent the money on it that I did if I'd known that I would get only three months use out of it. I also purchased an otterbox case for it at the same time. I never dropped the phone, got it near liquid, or caused damage to it in any way. But now I own and expensive HTC Windows 8 phone paper weight.Of course it would die after the 30 days return period, I am not pleased with this purchase or the seller either at this point. I also apologize to anyone that read my previous review and placed an order for it based on my comments.\n",
      "Did not last long, buyer beware! And they will not replace it as many other companies will. I get it's cheap, but in this case (pun intended,) it's worth it to spring for a better one--make sure to find one that they will replace!\n",

      "All of my family is a Windows Phone lover.. 4 Lumia 620's + 1 HTC 8X.I liked HTC 8x for better resolution, larger screen, better camera, and slim profile - so I thought of upgrading one of the last remaining \"Blackberry\" with this one. I love the WP8 OS, and I've been using it since over a year and have had no trouble on any of my devices with Microsoft Updates/Manufacturer updates, etc.This phone arrived just on time, but I immediately noticed the box was not an HTC box. It was a generic box. With self-printed sticker on the box indicating it's an HTC phone. The box contained charger, phone, the sim-card-insert-pin/clip, headphones. No manuals.Also noticed that the screen-protector was not original -- it seemed someone may have removed the original and placed a new phone without much care - and left many streaks/air-bubbles etc.Nonetheless, I turned on the phone, activated it and setup using Outlook account. And phone restarted suddenly -- there was no windows update or anything. I thought may be I did something. I checked through Setup also, and it showed there were no update available. Phone remained on for couple of hours and then it would continue restarting every 2-3 minutes, to a point where it completely died. I could not power it ON.I returned the phone and received the full refund.My opinion of this *particular shipment*: This phone either was not an original HTC, or it was a refurb. Either way, HTC / 8x / WP8 are have never given me trouble until this phone. So again, the problem must be with this particular inventory item.Here is my review of Lumia 620: http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZF0XAEUDTLL/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FP2PE22&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=\n",

      "Has great speakers, looks and feels fantastic and runs fast, however, it lacked the main thing I needed... being able to talk to people. The microphone came defective and it seems to be a common issue. A quick Google search for \"htc one bad microphone\" will show what I'm talking about. And what's even worse, this issue has been around since the previous HTC ONE (the M7). Which means that, even though HTC had years to find a solution, they seem to have ignored the issue and persist today.Again, the phone is very beautiful, runs fast, feels great in the hand, and has the best speakers of any phone I've played with. Just be ware that you might get a phone with a defective microphone, which is the main feature some of us want from a phone.\n",

She did not have permission or authority (our fault) to purchase it. When it came and we (parents) found out about it, the battery was dead and would not hold a charge of any kind. To use the phone it had to be plugged in. What's the purpose of having a cell (cordless) phone if you have to leave it plugged in to use?

At least that's what I want to believe the problem is. I can't see them being one of the few who actually take the time to answer your questions personally and then flat out lie. The phone is NOT 4G LTE, it is 4G.Even the box states LTE and so does the start screen. If you go into device, where the build info and all that is you can find all this type of information. I also asked if I could truly move apps to real external SD. When I went to app stats their was no option like this offered. I'm not talking about the app having the \"move to \"box but being shadowed out. Like most new systems that box doesn't exist in app stats anymore, it's all internal storage, except for your music n pix that you can store on external. It does have removable battery once you figure out how it comes apart! Lol Updated to 5.0 . Not the phone I was looking for and I emailed the company about some peoples relationship with their phone/brand. That they needed to get things straight. All though I didn't spend much time with this phone it looked and felt like a very nice phone. You would never suspect the price. The little I did do all worked well and felt good. They just got off on the wrong foot here. I hope they get their information straight so customers can benefit from their products in the future.\n",

The navigation is not intuitive at all. I am constantly having to exit out a ton of times because they have created all of these new actions that are just too much. Additionally there is no simple way to make a call like before-- finding contacts quickly won't happen, but it will make a ton of bad calls from your purse pocket because you can't lock it easily unless you have a password set, which brings up the keyboard which is not as easy as the other BBerry models.

I bought what i thout was 3 Blackberry 9530 Storm Unlocked For Any GSM Carrier Worldwide , spent around 450 dollars and they came locked with activation needed. After 2 emails sent to Ross Cellular and a phone call to amazon I got finnaly a message from the seller: You need to activate your phone... I dont enjoy loosing time and i dont enjoy buying wrongfull advertised items. I appreciate the seller response, which i really thank (could be worst not even having an answer..) but the point is , the product you advertise doesnt have an accurate description. Please be sure to have a full description of the products you sell. And if the phone is good for any carrier worldwide, why are the language options only ENGLISH?????? I'm from Portugal and I live in the states , I would like a phone with other language possibilities...I received a second email from ross cellular offering me 35 dollars refund to remove my feedback. How is this even allowed? My frustration, discontent and unsatisfaction are worth 35 dollars? Thank you But i rather loose this money and tell the truth. The phones should be working with any sim card as i received them and this didn't happen, i lost time and had a great effort to make them work because i'm not an expert on activating phones...\n",

The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.After 10 years with another well known Company, I decided to change companies because of my preference for Great Call phone. I switched toGreat Call Customer Service because using Great Call phone was not permitted with the previous company.I purchased the phone from Amazon with the intention of inspecting it and when my phone contract came to an end I would then have myprevious number transferred over to Great Call. This situation was explained to the 5 persons at Great Call Customer Service.Inspite of the aforementioned, I received 3 bills from Great Call's Customer Service with the threat of Collection Activity. I had also been toldthat I was given a Port phone number which was definitely not the case. There is a big difference between area code 561 and 954. Had I beenasked to use a phone number with area code 561 there is no question I would have refused to do so, as my contact with ATT had not come toan end.

Decent enough hardware, the real kicker is that BLU has ended all support for all of their Life phones (Life Play, Life View, Life One, Life Pure, etc). So, while the phone does work today, there will be no software updates. As Android moves forward, Blu Life phones will forever be stuck (on 4.2.1 for the Life Pure Mini).I've already run into a few instances where I can't install apps due to Android 4.3+ requirements.

Rhe graphics are crisp and sharp, the speed is faster than my Samsung galaxy 5 and my moms iphone5.... The speakers are the loudest I've ever heard on a phone before and to top it off my 10 year old played games on it all day christmas and it didn't even come close to dying... all day!

The loud speaker, camera (for what it is - disable the built-in app by revoking its permissions, and install Open Camera, set to 4.98 mega pixels since it's really only 5 mp) and GPS work well for me.

You can fine tune all volume levels etc. with one of the MTK engineering mode aps from Play Store. Free shpg. took 5 days.Doogee recommends rooting the device to get rid of the advertising malware (with delayed activation, so most reviewers didn't notice it) they installed, but refers you to Framaroot on their webpage, which doesn't work. Their two updates since also contain the malware. No more Doogee products for me. I hope they go out of business soon.To root: Search for the device on XDA Developers.

The stuff is embedded everywhere, even in the internet connection settings, proxies, etc. You get errors with almost everything. Yes, there are ways you can reconfigure for t-mobile but why go through all of that? The camera is acceptable in good lighting and close proximity but the flash is weak, total darkness. What kills this phone for me are no 3.5mm hole for my headset and the inability (as far as I know) to select multiple texts, pictures, etc for deletion. You have to press backspace and confirm delete, the most annoying procedure ever.I regret the purchase, but will keep the phone for 2 reasons......the MP3 player is solid and the phone's hardware and looks are admirable.

The \"screen protector\" also traps dirt and has some texturing that makes it really hard to see the screen in certain light.

      "UPDATE! I had one of the first reviews for this phone, (maybe the first?) on Amazon and I can no longer recommend this phone for US customers. No US GSM carrier has sold this phone so Nokia has apparently decided it is not worth supporting in the US. They have some way of identifying the hardware and the new firmware is not available or downloadable through their software application. They have not only added features but according to release notes they have added bug fixes. Great, now I know I have a phone with software bugs that will never be fixed. My phone is also dropping calls indoors where I have never had problems with previous phones. I wonder if that is one of the bug fixes.I tried to open a ticket with Nokia customer support, this was my response from May 3rd.Thank you for contacting Nokia.You will be receiving a reply from one of our Customer Care Representatives at the earliest.Have a good day.It's June 9th, haven't heard a thing. Nice way to treat your customers.I had to replace the phone on my ATT plan ( Nokia Mural ) because the battery life was horrible, it dropped calls, would not receive calls and the menu navigation was awful.I am not interested in a smart phone. My top priorities are battery life, call quality and ease of use. I could also care less about a camera in a phone. I also carry my phone in my pocket so the size and shape of this phone is important. For the 2 weeks I have owned this phone it has met all of these criteria. I went 3 days before the first charge and that was after playing with all the phones features like WLAN, bluetooth camera and media player and I still had battery left. The call quality is superb, people talking to me on the other end have also noticed the difference, no dropped callls so far. The ring volume is EXCELLENT! The main screen and goto menus are totally customizable so if you don't find this phone easy to use it is your own fault. The resistive touch makes navigation easy. The screen is also very clear and the picture quality is excellent. Texting uses the traditional key pad and utilizes the touch feature for special charachters. This phone is thin and the back is rounded so it carries well in my pocket, sometimes I forget it is there.Now for the extra features. The camera takes pretty awful pictures but I find that true with most phones. Flash photography on this thing produces incredibly washed out colors. I the WLAN feature is great!, the default browser is very poor but it also comes with Opera Mini web browser pre-installed and that works surprisingly well. This does not surf the web as well as a \"smart\" phone but it is certainly tolerable. One of my favorite features is the * button can be held down for 3 seconds to turn on the camera flash for a flashlight. Love it! So far the software support from Nokia is poor because the phone is so new. There is no ActiveSync which I think is true for most phone. SUPL location, which uses tower triangulation to find your location, is available but I have not found an app that it works with yet. The java google maps does not support the touch screen. It comes with a built in mail app which support gmail. The is no plugin yet for Apple iSync. Hopefully there will be better software choices the longer this phone is out. The music player is relatively good, decent sound and a regular sized headphone jack is awesome. I also appreciate the ability to charge with both the Nokia barrel charger and micro usb.I own an ipod touch which senses electrical conductivity, this phone differs in that it uses resistive touch which senses pressure. It is not as sensitive but has the advantage of not exposing a glass surface ( possibly more durable ) and you could still use it with gloves on.

This may be in part to the fact that I installed Kapersky Security about the same time, also use LockWatch.\n",

The only thing I dislike is the charger port, it takes a special BLU charger so try not to ruin the charger it came with is my advise lol.Update: had to throw it away!! I've had it about 6 months you get what you pay for! It completely spazzed out of nowhere. Stopped charging I even purchased 3 new chargers for it.

      "This is my second review about ross cellular. I bought what i thout was 3 Blackberry 9530 Storm Unlocked For Any GSM Carrier Worldwide , spent around 450 dollars and they came locked with activation needed. After 2 emails sent to Ross Cellular and a phone call to amazon I got finnaly a message from the seller: You need to activate your phone... I dont enjoy loosing time and i dont enjoy buying wrongfull advertised items. I appreciate the seller response, which i really thank (could be worst not even having an answer..) but the point is , the product you advertise doesnt have an accurate description. Please be sure to have a full description of the products you sell. And if the phone is good for any carrier worldwide, why are the language options only ENGLISH?????? I'm from Portugal and I live in the states , I would like a phone with other language possibilities...I received a second email from ross cellular offering me 35 dollars refund to remove my feedback. How is this even allowed? My frustration, discontent and unsatisfaction are worth 35 dollars? Thank you But i rather loose this money and tell the truth. The phones should be working with any sim card as i received them and this didn't happen, i lost time and had a great effort to make them work because i'm not an expert on activating phones...\n",

The stuff is embedded everywhere, even in the internet connection settings, proxies, etc. You get errors with almost everything. Yes, there are ways you can reconfigure for t-mobile but why go through all of that? The camera is acceptable in good lighting and close proximity but the flash is weak, total darkness. What kills this phone for me are no 3.5mm hole for my headset and the inability (as far as I know) to select multiple texts, pictures, etc for deletion. You have to press backspace and confirm delete, the most annoying procedure ever.I regret the purchase, but will keep the phone for 2 reasons......the MP3 player is solid and the phone's hardware and looks are admirable.

The phones design and speed is perfect. I love the way it feels in my hand and how it looks. I really wish they would have taken more time with this product because it could have really been great.

When I called anyone, the keyboard screen would pop up and it would not go away. Not even when the person that I was talking to hang up on me. So I have to reboot my phone to get it go away. This phone is not worth your time and effort just buy another phone but this one. Now I'm not sure all Verykool phones are like this. But this one is the wrost phone I ever had because of that one thing. If it wa not for that one thing, it would have been a OK phone. I mean the screen is nice and clear and battery lasted a good while. Yes this is not that fast of a phone but it was fast enough for my needs. I just wish this phone would have been a good phone but I got my hopes up too high. So I'm not sure if I will buy another Verykool phone again. And just think I was going to buy the 6 inch Verykool phone they had. But now I'm not because of this phone. So this was my first Verykool and last until they can prove me other wise.\n",

I am not happy, but you get what you pay for so my fault for buying it. I think I will have to get something newer. Just didn't want to have to spend more money. I would NOT recommend this phone at all...\n",

      "This phone came with a malfunctioning battery that was $80 to replace because the phone was purchased over 3 years ago. The seller clearly knew about the issue and decided to pawn off the problem to an innocent buyer. The camera also failed the diagnostics test--another problem that was not made apparent until after purchase. It is ridiculous to not be notified of this upon purchase. I looked through several other phones and decided this one was the best choice because i was not made aware by the seller that the phone was not able to function. I am extremely frustrated with the results and hope that no one else has to experience this ridiculousness.\n",

Multiple contact with cell provider, many trips to Best Buy to talk to the Samsung representative and still dropped calls, dropped emails, text failures, poor internet connection.
